# Notes on Sp(2N) optimisations.

The optimisation is done getting rid of the lower half of the gauge matrices.
(in the fundamental representation). For explanations, please have a look at
Appendix A in 
["Sp(4) gauge theory on the lattice: towards SU(4)/Sp(4) composite Higgs (and beyond)"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.04220.pdf)
