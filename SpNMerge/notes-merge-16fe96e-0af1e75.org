* Issues
- [[TestProgram/Inverters/check_inverters_2]]
  It's an executable file that should not be tracked while it is (on master)
- [[TestProgram/DiracOperator/speed_test_diracoperator_flt.c]]
  ~MPI_PID~ still used
- [[TestProgram/Propagator/check_propagator.c]]
  the structure of the code was heavily modified,
  and might require attention
