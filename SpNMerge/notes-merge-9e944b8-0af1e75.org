* Issues
- [[TestProgram/Inverters/check_inverters_2]]
  It's an executable file that should not be tracked while it is (on master)
- [[TestProgram/DiracOperator/speed_test_diracoperator_flt.c]]
  ~MPI_PID~ still used
- [[TestProgram/Propagator/check_propagator.c]]
  the structure of the code was heavily modified,
  and might require attention
* master (0af1e75) to 9e944b8 [74/74]
** DONE HMC/hmc.c
- removed call to end_mc()
** DONE HMC/hmc_forces.c
- rlxd_init call does not use + MPI_PID for the seed.
** DONE HMC/hmc_utils.c
- removed definition of "end_mc()"
** DONE HMC/hmc_utils.h
- removed declaration of "end_mc()"
** DONE Include/dirac.h
- added declaration of Dphi_fused_
** DONE Include/geometry.h
- geometry_descriptor has "fuse_*" masks and counters/size
- FUSE_* macros using _OMP_
** DONE Include/global.h
- new "path blocking size" variables?
** DONE Include/glueballs.h
- changed declaration of measure_1pt_glueballs (nblocking now splitted in start and end)
** DONE Include/memory.h
- ALIGN changed to 8
** DONE Include/ranlux.h
no changes (only formatting?)
** DONE Include/update.h
- in ~update_hb_multilevel_gb_measure~ now blocking has been split
  into ~nblockingstart~ and ~nblockingend~
** DONE LibHR/Geometry/communications.c
- fixed typo in log message
** DONE LibHR/Geometry/geometry_init.c
- added log message
** DONE LibHR/Geometry/geometry_mpi_eo.c
- new function ~eval_fusemask~
- ~walk_on_lattice~ now not static
- loop on sites on ~walk_on_lattice~ now nested inside 4 loops on blocks?
** DONE LibHR/Geometry/process_init.c
- Requiring now MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED
- ~rlxd_init~ now does not use +MPI_PID for seeding
** DONE LibHR/Geometry/test_geometry_mpi.c
- commented out code was removed.
** DONE LibHR/IO/read_action.c
- increased "content" size, checking read files now.
** DONE LibHR/Memory/amalloc.c
- cast to char* added

** DONE LibHR/Observables/glueballs.c
- ~measure_1pt_glueballs~ now uses ~nblockingstart~ and ~nblockingend~
  instead of only ~nblocking~.
- some changed logic likely related to the "split" (not investigating)
** DONE LibHR/Random/ranlxd.c
- ~include "global.h"~ added
- ~static void error~ now ~static void local_error~
- now ~+ MPI_PID~ added in seed initialisation inside ~rlxd_init~.
- new definitions of a bunch of function in the openmp case (~#ifdef~ guarded.)
** DONE LibHR/Random/ranlxs.c
My assumption is that this is like ~ranlxd.c~ but for single precision.  If so,
it seems to have the same changes as ~ranlxd.c~.
** DONE LibHR/Update/D_ff.c
- bunch of pointers moved from ~extern~ to ~static~
- added ~static~ functions to free and allocate said pointers
** DONE LibHR/Update/Dphi.c

** DONE LibHR/Update/force_fermion_core.c
- moved declaration of temp variables inside ~_SITE_FOR~ loop.
** DONE LibHR/Update/random_su2.c
- changes for omp multithreading so that each thread can call random_su2 independently.
  (e.g., every variable is now a vector and every thread has his own lane)
** DONE LibHR/Update/staples.c
- staple, tr1, tr2, *p[1,2,3], nu, i, ixpmy, ixpnu, ixmnu, ixmumnu not static anymore
** DONE LibHR/Update/updated_hb_multilevel.c
- ~update_hb_multilevel_gb_measure~ now uses ~nblockingstart~ and ~nblockingend~
   instead of ~nblocking~ only.  It is a recursive function that at each level
  calls ~measure_1pt_glueballs~ .
** DONE LibHR/Utils/suN_exp_group.c
- additional ~_OMP_BARRIER~ and ~_OMP_PRAGMA(single)~ added in 4 functions
** DONE LibHR/Utils/wilsonflow.c
In general: not working on ~u_gauge~ anymore (bugfix?)
- ~u_gauge_backup~ renamed to ~Vtmp~?
- ~ifdef~ regarding ~BC_T_OPEN~ wrapping function call
- removed alloc & init of ~wf_plaq_weight~ from ~WF_set_bare_anisotropy~.
- ~wf_plaq_weight~ not symmetrized anymore? (line 70)
- removed commented out code
- use of renamed ~suNg_Exp~ function
- in ~max_distance~, ~Wprime~ renamed to ~Vprimel~
- in ~WilsonFlow3_adaptive~, NOT backing up GLOBAL ~u_gauge~, instead copy ~V~ to ~Vtmp~
  (~V~ is an argument). (bugfix?)
- ~ifdef~'s on ~PLAQ_WEIGHTS~ disappeared
- difference by a factor of 6 in some places
- some debug printouts added.
