# Tests that are not run for SP(N)

- Gaugefix (see su2_hit issue)

# Tests that do not work for SP(N) 

- Mesons/check_triplets_3
- Mesons/check_triplets_4

NOTE: they don't work on the master branch for SUN and on our branch for SUN 
      either (fail with segmentation fault in both cases).
      The SUN cases seem to succeed on the github CI, so maybe it can be due
      to compiler/libraries versions.
