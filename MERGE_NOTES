Converter/archive_eolexi.c

Some differences only in the read functions. In the write functions, 
everything should be 'covariant'. It is suboptimal that in the write functions,
MPI communications take actually double than the amount of data needed. 
This is, though, the same that happens for SON. 
Since this is not a critical region of the code, we have not changed that. 

HMC/hmc.c
In the SPN version, 'fenv.h' was included (possibly for testing).
All changes will be discarded, except the insertions at lines 205-206.

HMC/hmc_forces.c
A Trivial lptinf change.

LLR_HB/llr_hb.c
This file was not present in the non-spn version.

LLR_HMC/llr_hmc.c
This file was not present in the non-spn version.


LibHR/Random/random_suNg.c
* The function 'random_suNg_unit_vector' is declared in Include/random.h,
  but defined in LibHR/Random/random_suNg.c only in the SPN version.
  Since it seems that it is not needed anywhere (even in the SPN version),
  I will not add it to the 'trunk' version.
* the function random_suNg_epsilon is not present in the 'trunk'. 
  In the SPN version, is only used in the update_constrained function, which
  is used in LLR stuff. Not added to it.
Added the other SPN-related changes, but removed the lines that were 
commented out.

LibHR/Update/cabmar.c
* Copied as is from SPN version, then added 'static inline' modifier to wtos
  function declaration.

LibHR/Update/random_momenta.c
* Conditional for the number of generators added. Function gaussian_scalar_momenta
  is missing in SPN version.

LibHR/Update/representation.c
* In the SPN version, _group_represent2 is 'plugged' to _group_represent.
* The SPN version lacks some things the the trunk version has.

LibHR/Utils/TMPL/suN_exp.c.tmpl
* Copied as is from SPN version.

LibHR/Utils/det_suNg.c
* Copied as is from the SPN version.

LibHR/Utils/inv_suNg.c
* Copied as is from the SPN version.

LibHR/Utils/suN_utils.c
* Copied a large ifdef. The trunk version has modifications that the SPN version
  has not.

Make/Utils/autosun/adjoint.h
* Copied as is from the SPN version.

Make/Utils/autosun/antisymmetric.h
* Copied as is from the SPN version.

Make/Utils/autosun/fundamental.h
* Copied as is from the SPN version.

Make/Utils/autosun/representation.h
* Copied as is from the SPN version.

Make/Utils/autosun/sun.h
* Copied as is from the SPN version.

Make/Utils/autosun/symmetric.h
* Copied as is from the SPN version.

RenormalizationFactors/measure_Z_mom.c
* Copied as is from the SPN version - only lprintf modifications.

Spectrum/measure_formfactor.c
* Copied as is from the SPN version - only lprintf modifications.

Spectrum/measure_spectrum.c
* Lots of work in the trunk version not present in the SPN version.
  Added lprintf modification.

Spectrum/mk_mesons_with_z2semwall_new.c
* Copied as is from the SPN version - only lprintf modifications.

TestProgram/Deflate/check_deflate.c
* Copied as is from the SPN version - only lprintf modifications.

TestProgram/Propagator/check_propagator.c
* Copied as is from the SPN version - only lprintf modifications.

WilsonFlow/WF_measure.c
* Copied as is from the SPN version - only lprintf modifications.

WilsonFlow/WF_measure_adaptative.c
* Copied as is from the SPN version - only lprintf modifications.
